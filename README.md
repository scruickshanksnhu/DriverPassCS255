# DriverPassCS255
CS-255 Portfolio


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

DriverPass is a company looking to create a system which allows users to book reservations for Driving hours. They wanted a relatively simple system that allowed users to make/change/cancel reservations. DriverPass employees also had the need to access information even without internet coverage. I think my current business experience lent itself well to this project. I think I have a lot of prior experience creating UML charts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think overall the DriverPass program was functional and sound, but there is definitely some shortcomings with things like security, accessibility, and localization to name a few examples. I think implementing a speech-to-text functionality, and adding some encryption on the customer data would be a nice start. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ultimately it's the user who is going to be using your product. You could develop the fanciest application of all time, but if it's unintuitive and not user-friendly, why should they use it? This course did a nice job showing how the client interview process can be a wealth of knowledge in regards to users needs. I think constantly taking user-stories is also a fantastic way to be constantly measuring how satisfied your system's users are. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think Agile is probably the way to go. I admire it's ability to handle changes on the fly, as well as the relatively narrow scope of workgroups compared with other methodologies. I really enjoyed the UML documenting in this course. I found the UML class diagrams especially intuitive, and will undoubtedly use these models in the future.
